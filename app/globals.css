OK, so this is an example file and not something rigorous, right?

What we're doing here is simplifying some things by setting global styles
for H1 and other tags.  It would be annoying (and error prone) if we have
to type out an _exact_ set of tailwind classes on every H1 (assuming we want
all H1 tags to look identical).

So this is an example to show how we can set some 'global styles'.

What's nice is that if we pick an H1 tag, then change one of these values
in a component, these will be overridden.  Yay for CSS.

At the bottom? There is a rtl and ltr class that lets us style our menu as
a pure-CSS drop-down on the right-edge of the screen.  These let the menu
drop-down AND not overflow off the right edge of the screen (which is the default).
